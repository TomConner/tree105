## Leaving Your Tree for Curbside Pickup

### The Do’s

Please remove all ornaments and the tree stand before leaving your tree for pickup.

Place the tree curbside in front of your residence.  If special instructions to locate your residence or your tree are needed, please include that information in the Comments section of your on-line registration.

Please have your tree out by 9:00 am on Saturday, January 7th before our tree pickup begins.

### The Don’ts

We cannot accept trees with tinsel, trees with nails or screws (please remove tree stand), artificial trees, wreaths with metal shape wires, or trees with any other metal attached.  Thank you for your understanding.

## Problems? Questions? Missed Tree?

The Tree Drive is an all-volunteer effort by Scouts and their adult leaders and parents.  Should you have any questions or encounter any issues, you can contact us.

If we miss your tree on Saturday, January 7th, please let us know ASAP.  There may be limited pickup on the Sunday morning after pickup day.

Please be aware that inclement weather may interfere with our tree pickup.  We will do our best to contact all our registered customers if we anticipate a change of date due to inclement weather.  If inclement weather is in our forecast, please check your email and/or Pembroke Connect and Pembroke Chat on Facebook for our updates.  The safety of our Scouts and volunteers is our priority.
